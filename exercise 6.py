Exercise 06
Write a program that calculates a „Delta” for the quadratic equation  as below. 
y = 3x2 - 4x + 1

The formula for Delta is as following:
y = ax2  + bx + c 
Delta = b2 – 4ac

hint: first you have to declare 3 variables: a, b, c

Expected result, print to terminal: 
"Delta equals: 4"
'''

a = 3
b = 4
c = 1

Delta = b ** 2 - 4 * a * c
print("Delta equals:", Delta)
